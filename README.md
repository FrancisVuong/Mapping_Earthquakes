# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview 
In this project we help Basil and Sadhana create an earthquake map with different maps and overlays. They wanted to see the earthquake data in relation to teh tectonic plates' location on the earth, specifically the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5. 

## Results 

In order to gather the data and layouts for the maps we created a mapbox account to utilize their API.
